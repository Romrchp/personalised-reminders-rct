The app would be better with audio input too.</li></ul><h3>Question: How personalized did the app experience feel to you? If it was not, what would make the app feel more personalized to you ?</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> I would appreciate if the app provided guidance against my status and goals. Currently it’s only descriptive. Without ‘so what’ I would probably stop using it after the initial insights.</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> It was really useful to have a chatbot there that you can discuss with. It would be nice to have daily calorie intake suggestions listed as well along with the food pyramid.</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> The app should learn that I am having (almost) the same breakfast every morning.</li></ul><h3>Question: How relevant was the information provided to you during the study, with regard to your personal situation ?</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> 5</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> 5</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> 1</li></ul><h3>Question: Please explain what made the information relevant or irrelevant to your situation.</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> I finally understood how many kcal I consume and how balanced my food is.

Which did not ?</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> I only received notifications per SMS and did not get the information about when the study would begin, I understood I had more flexibility choosing when to start. I was on a work trip and couldn’t pay attention to it.</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> In general the estimate from text entry was okay but not very accurate. Often I explicitly entered calories and nutritional values and it was not recognized.</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> Text description. Don't always want to take a photo of the food.</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> User interface not really appealing and partly very old-fashioned (looks like backend devs did the UI), missing activity tracking (it influences how much you should eat), correction options not immediately accessible or not clear that you should use the comment function, statistics not very meaningful – would have liked more details</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> Text entry was often necessary, camera worked less well</li><li><strong>Response 6:</strong> Less good: nutrition values… that soymilk 200 ml had 435 kcal? Or ice cubes; correction function changed incorrectly recognized foods but didn't adjust the values accordingly. Best: photo and breakdown into fat, protein, etc.</li><li><strong>Response 7:</strong> How many kcal per day for my height, weight, and age? What target per meal? On the other hand, the NLP text comments were super useful to edit and interact with the AI.</li><li><strong>Response 8:</strong> I enjoyed the possibility of using the chat bot to log meals and make corrections</li></ul><h3>Question: How personalized did the app experience feel to you? If it was not, what would make the app feel more personalized to you ?</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> nan</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> Not really personalized. Honestly I wasn't aware anything was personalized.</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> My wife received personal messages. I did not get them the same way.</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> Better user interface, weekly summaries or tips for the coming week, recipe ideas</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> The app didn’t feel personal and I didn’t expect it to.</li><li><strong>Response 6:</strong> Not very… I liked the duplicate function…</li><li><strong>Response 7:</strong> I didn’t see personalization or recommendations.</li><li><strong>Response 8:</strong> not incredibly personalised would be good to be able to connect with something like apple health to include other metrics</li></ul><h3>Question: How relevant was the information provided to you during the study, with regard to your personal situation ?</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> 3</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> 4</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> 3</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> 4</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> 1</li><li><strong>Response 6:</strong> 1</li><li><strong>Response 7:</strong> 2</li><li><strong>Response 8:</strong> 2</li></ul><h3>Question: Please explain what made the information relevant or irrelevant to your situation.</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> nan</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> nan</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> nan</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> Relevant because I often do sports and want to know how much and what nutrients I consume</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> I didn't look at any results, there were only a few statistics anyway</li><li><strong>Response 6:</strong> Never got info about my personal situation… apart from reminders to enter something… that was incorrect because I only have drinks for breakfast… the app could have picked that up… I liked being able to decide for myself what to look at to adjust the next meal!</li><li><strong>Response 7:</strong> What max or min values should I aim for per day or meal? This information wasn’t there.</li><li><strong>Response 8:</strong> I do not feel that much information was provided to me regarding my personal situation</li></ul><h3>Question: Did you feel supported by the app during your food tracking journey ?</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> 3</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> 3</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> 4</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> 4</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> 1</li><li><strong>Response 6:</strong> 4</li><li><strong>Response 7:</strong> 2</li><li><strong>Response 8:</strong> 2</li></ul><h3>Question: If any, what type of support would have been most helpful during your food tracking journey?</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> nan</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> nan</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> Reminders</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> Weekly analysis and tips for the coming week</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> For that the app would have to know much more about me; the food composition was nice, but not more.</li><li><strong>Response 6:</strong> Complete correction of wrongly recognized foods. I then entered them by text and deleted the photo entry!</li><li><strong>Response 7:</strong> It was obvious the SMS support was generic because I got reminders even when I had already logged my meals.</li><li><strong>Response 8:</strong> suggests of what could be missing in day to day meals to reach healthy eating goals for example</li></ul><h3>Question: Any additional comments or feedback about your experience :</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> Also, to give clearer feedback at this stage, I would suggest you run interviews instead of forms to get much detailed feedback from people while using the app, or at least voice notes within the app. You can delete my answers from the study because I don’t think these will help you build a better product. Thanks for the opportunity anyway!</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> Generally a very nice idea! The app was easy to use and overall worked quite well. Some functions would have been very helpful, e.g. saving meals or more precise recognition of photos, e.g. of nutrition tables on food.</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> nan</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> Feedback survey is very cumbersome to fill out, feels like the app itself a bit old-fashioned and unconsidered, otherwise great initiative and good luck</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> nan</li><li><strong>Response 6:</strong> Compared to e.g. the Fitbit app I found this app absolutely helpful to plan meals and see trends. Since I like to eat it is not always clear how many calories it is. Also I like the idea that EPFL has the data instead of commercial companies. I will buy it if possible. Good luck!</li><li><strong>Response 7:</strong> Take inspiration from the Yazio app for all the nutritional parts. Add the AI layer to it!</li><li><strong>Response 8:</strong> nan</li></ul><h2>Study Group: 2.0</h2><h3>Question: How motivated did you feel to track your meals during the study ?</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> 4</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> 5</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> 2</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> 5</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> 5</li></ul><h3>Question: What best describes your engagement with the app over the 14 days of study?</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> My engagement decreased over time</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> My engagement stayed consistent</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> My engagement decreased over time</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> My engagement remained steady</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> My engagement increased over time</li></ul><h3>Question: What motivated you most to keep using the app ?</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> To see if it could accurately estimate the macros and calorie content of my food. To check how much protein/carbs/fat/calories I was actually consuming each day</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> I already log my food, so I am used to it</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> I only used it the first day and then forgot (no notifications)</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> Evaluating the quality of image recognition</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> I was able to build an understanding of the amount of calories I consume daily.</li></ul><h3>Question: Describe any changes you noticed in your eating behavior, if any, while using the app.</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> nan</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> nan</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> I only ate 30g of cashew nuts because that was the default portion in the app for this product. So using the app did influence my eating behavior.</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> No notable change</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> I could more easily stick to my target behaviour (fewer total calories, less sugar).</li></ul><h3>Question: How well did the app's features adapt to your individual needs and preferences ?</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> 4</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> 3</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> 4</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> 5</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> 4</li></ul><h3>Question: Which specific features worked best for your needs ? Which did not ?</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> Best: easy to record with camera, barcode, or text. Worst: the interface would not let me inspect what dish ingredients were actually identified. The calories were consistently underestimated. I would like to see a breakdown per dish element to explore substitutions</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> The ability to log food with a picture or text, I often used a mix.</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> Barcode scanning and product recognition (packaging) worked well. Entering quantities was unintuitive at first.</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> Meals had to be entered in real time. Impossible to log a meal one day late.</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> Entering photos and text was the best part.</li></ul><h3>Question: How personalized did the app experience feel to you? If it was not, what would make the app feel more personalized to you ?</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> It would feel more personalized if it suggested changes based on past observations. Replacements of ingredients or dishes, etc.</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> It did not feel particularly personalized. It would have been useful to be able to log by saying 'same thing I had for dinner last night' and have it able to understand that.</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> Didn't feel personalized</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> I’d gladly use a similar app daily. What I missed was an evaluation of the calorie deficit needed to lose weight.</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> Saving my target behaviour – I have more ideas, happy to share if asked</li></ul><h3>Question: How relevant was the information provided to you during the study, with regard to your personal situation ?</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> 3</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> 2</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> 3</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> 5</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> 2</li></ul><h3>Question: Please explain what made the information relevant or irrelevant to your situation.</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> What information?</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> The only information provided was macronutrients and kcals, which did not seem very accurate as the portion estimation wasn't great.</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> Hard to say for me since I only used it the first day</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> Total calories + macronutrients were very useful information.</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> It was not relevant to my food.</li></ul><h3>Question: Did you feel supported by the app during your food tracking journey ?</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> 3</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> 4</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> 2</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> 5</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> 5</li></ul><h3>Question: If any, what type of support would have been most helpful during your food tracking journey?</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> There was no feedback on accuracy. The calories were consistently underestimated, to the point that if I had eaten the amount predicted during these 12 days I would have been maybe malnourished or at least lost some weight. There should be a baseline estimate of calorie intake based on my weight and lifestyle, and then checks to see if the daily calorie track was actually reasonable</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> nan</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> Reminders (notifications) at typical meal times to use the app.</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> I'm missing information about my metabolism and the calorie deficit I need.</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> The chatbot was effective.</li></ul><h3>Question: Any additional comments or feedback about your experience :</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> Very interesting setup. I hope to try further developments of this in the future</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> Problems I noticed: - I almost always got 'upload failed' after uploading an image or entering text, I had to retry several times before the upload succeeded. - The portion estimation from photos was not very accurate, so I often had to manually edit the portions. This was often complicated as I knew how much cooked rice I had eaten, but the logged food was uncooked rice, so I had to figure out the conversion factor. - A few times when I uploaded an image and it detected a food incorrectly I would enter a comment to change the food, instead of changing the food it would change the amount of the incorrect food. Eg. 'Those were sweet potatoes, not regular potatoes'. Reply: 'I have updated the amount of potatoes to 350g'. Otherwise the experience was quite good.</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> * First use * - Didn't understand if I should enter quantity and there was no unit or way to add one (unknown product photographed) - Didn't get the default quantity 1g (focus water) - Default quantity 30g of Ültje Cashew made me eat only that instead of finishing the whole 150g. First use when entering by text - all good * Other remarks - Completely forgot after first day => Notifications to improve compliance</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> nan</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> Do you plan to offer this app commercially? Are you looking for staff support?</li></ul><h2>Study Group: 3.0</h2><h3>Question: How motivated did you feel to track your meals during the study ?</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> 5</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> 4</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> 5</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> 5</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> 4</li><li><strong>Response 6:</strong> 2</li><li><strong>Response 7:</strong> 4</li><li><strong>Response 8:</strong> 4</li></ul><h3>Question: What best describes your engagement with the app over the 14 days of study?</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> My engagement stayed consistent</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> My engagement decreased over time</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> My engagement stayed consistent</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> My engagement stayed consistent</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> My engagement decreased over time</li><li><strong>Response 6:</strong> My engagement decreased over time</li><li><strong>Response 7:</strong> My engagement varied a lot from day to day</li><li><strong>Response 8:</strong> My engagement stayed consistent</li></ul><h3>Question: What motivated you most to keep using the app ?</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> To help app development </li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> To figure out if it will recognize the foods correctly</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> The will to understand what exactly is my diet, am I eating too many calories and what constitutes my diet</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> To have an idea of my calorie intake and plan the following meal to balance it out</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> Control calories and protein</li><li><strong>Response 6:</strong> I thought the notifications/SMS were actually a good idea.</li><li><strong>Response 7:</strong> Ease of use with the option to edit via chatbot</li><li><strong>Response 8:</strong> Contribute to science</li></ul><h3>Question: Describe any changes you noticed in your eating behavior, if any, while using the app.</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> nan</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> nan</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> None.

Which did not ?</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> Camera</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> Picture recognition</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> I mostly focused on the camera as I was challenged by two things: food that I cooked myself I could correct the camera results versus food in restaurants where I do not know exactly the composition and therefore rather dependent on what the app was telling me. Some issues were easy to correct (glass of champagne versus glass of beer) others I did not know if the result was really correct. One issue that I noticed is that I drink about 1–2 liters of water a day and never logged it because it’s out of the meal scope.</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> The best way was the possibility to add comments and adapt from the picture. The lack of fiber monitoring and no distinction between sugars and complex carbohydrates are important information I wish I had.</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> Bad: The buttons for photo/scan/text should be at the bottom. Otherwise you have to use the other hand. Bad: With pre-entered products you don't always see in detail how many calories and proteins are in them.</li><li><strong>Response 6:</strong> nan</li><li><strong>Response 7:</strong> Barcode – most scanned products were not in the database</li><li><strong>Response 8:</strong> There is no use tracking food and getting advice with no documentation of physical activity. </li></ul><h3>Question: How personalized did the app experience feel to you? If it was not, what would make the app feel more personalized to you ?</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> Would be good to provide context: during the 14 days I had a competition for which my eating habits changed before and the competition day was a special day, then I went on vacation where again my eating habits were different</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> Not</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> The app (and this is a minor issue) did not adapt to my eating patterns – very early breakfast and early dinner – so the SMS reminder is good but was off. I think the app should prompt you to remind you if you forget to add something (meal without any liquids for example) or if it detects a certain pattern and should prompt you why you did not eat or drink this now.</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> Set specific goals and see based on your consumption how you are doing with respect to them.</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> Nothing special</li><li><strong>Response 6:</strong> nan</li><li><strong>Response 7:</strong> No SMS but direct notifications in the app</li><li><strong>Response 8:</strong> Track physical activity and other circumstances such as weather and conditions if activity is outdoors</li></ul><h3>Question: How relevant was the information provided to you during the study, with regard to your personal situation ?</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> 3</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> 2</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> 4</li><li><strong>Response 4:</strong> 4</li><li><strong>Response 5:</strong> 5</li><li><strong>Response 6:</strong> 3</li><li><strong>Response 7:</strong> 3</li><li><strong>Response 8:</strong> 4</li></ul><h3>Question: Please explain what made the information relevant or irrelevant to your situation.</h3><ul><li><strong>Response 1:</strong> nan</li><li><strong>Response 2:</strong> nan</li><li><strong>Response 3:</strong> Relevant in eating other foods – whereas the suggestions were very limited – two food groups in my case – and interestingly did not criticize my choices.
