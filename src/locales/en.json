It consists of 13 components that reflect the main dietary recommendations for what constitutes an 'ideal' diet. These components fall into two main categories:\n\n - Adequacy components represent food groups, subgroups, and nutrients that should be consumed in sufficient amounts. For these components, higher scores indicate higher (and thus more desirable) intakes.\n\n - Moderation components reflect food groups and dietary elements that should be limited. In this case, higher scores indicate lower intakes, which is more desirable.\n\n Each of the 13 components is scored according to specific standards, aiming for a total score of 100 points when summed. Some dietary aspects are represented by two components, each with a maximum of 5 points, while the remaining components can each score up to 10 points.\n Below is a detailed breakdown of all the categories:",
